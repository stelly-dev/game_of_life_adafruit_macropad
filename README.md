# Game of Life on Macropad

---

A simple toy for fidgeting with your macropad.

## Dependencies

In addition to the default macropad libs, you'll also need to
add the [Adafruit ImageLoad](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ImageLoad) library

## Instructions:

Press the button on the lower right to start the cell editor

From there, use the four buttons lit blue for cardinal directions
The center button that's pinkish blue selects/deselects a cell

to bring your creation to life, again press the lower right button,
this will also pause the simulation and bring you back into the cell editor
if the game is already running

if you've made a mess, press the lower left button in edit mode
to clear the board.
